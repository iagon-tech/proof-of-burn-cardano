abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a new paradigm to build decentralized systems
which do not require a central authority. It is most popular for enabling Bitcoin
and other crypto-currencies. However, blockchain applications span beyond Finance,
and recently it has been applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance,
in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure.
In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms
that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain
experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared
by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation
tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity,
DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha,
which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

ABSTRACT       = {Over the last decade, blockchain technology has emerged to provide solutions to the complexity and privacy challenges of using distributed databases. It reduces cost for customers by eliminating intermediaries and builds trust in peer-to-peer communications. Over this time, the concept of blockchain has shifted greatly due to its potential in business growth for enterprises and the rapidly evolving applications in a collaborative smart-city ecosystem, healthcare, and governance. Many platforms, with different architectures and consensus protocols, have been introduced. Consequently, it becomes challenging for an application developer to choose the right platform. Furthermore, blockchain has misaligned with the goals for an efficient green collaborative digital ecosystem. Therefore, it becomes critical to address this gap and to build new frameworks to align blockchain with those goals. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of blockchain architecture and consensus protocols, bringing a retrospective analysis and discussing the rationale of the evolution of the various architectures and protocols, as well as capturing the assumptions conducive to their development and contributions to building collaborative applications. We introduce a classification of those architectures helping developers to choose a suitable platform for applications and providing insights for future research directions in the field to build new frameworks.},

abstract = {This article provides insight into how “Blockchains” work. A block chain or Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records that are hardened against tampering and revision, even by operators of the data store's nodes. One can view a Blockchain as a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to previous blocks forming a chain. Importantly, blocks are added to the Blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each miner gets a copy of the Blockchain when joining the Bitcoin network. The Blockchain they receive has complete and accurate information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
